Programming Exercise 1 - Polymorphism

 

Create a parent class Shape.  Create four children classes: Square, Cube, Triangle, and Pyramid.  The Pyramid class represents a 4 sided pyramid with a triangle base, not a 5 sided pyramid with a square base.

- Each child class will have a private double side, with getters and setters.  

- Each child class should also have a method called getArea() which will calculate the area of the shape.  For 3D shapes getArea() should return the surface area.

 

Create a test class TestShape.  Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an ArrayList of Shapes, and fill the ArrayList with child objects.  The ArrayList should contain at least 8 objects (at least 2 of each child). In a loop, call the getArea() method for each object in the ArrayList.



Programming Exercise 2 - JavaFX

 

Write a Hello World JavaFX GUI program.   

- Your class must extend Application and implement a start method().  

- Your class should have 4 layers; a stage, a scene, a pane, and text.

- Hello and World should be in different colors.
